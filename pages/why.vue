						<h3>You are a frontend developer with love for CSS</h3>
						<p>
							Other frameworks give you a lot of tools and classes and already styled components. While the most fun in
							actually making something is to make something. Not to click everything together with the right classes and make
							something which looks like many other projects.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						<h3>It's lightweight</h3>
						<p>
							The basics of henri's is really light weight, in fact.. adding it into your project doesn't cost you anything
							size wise. You can add components and other styling as you go to not bloat your project.
						</p>
						<P>
							The fact that it doesn't have any output, means you could for instance add henri's to your main css, with some
							output if you want. And add it still to all other components (like in Vue), where you can use all functionalities
							of Henri's without adding any extra or double weight.
						</P>
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						<h3>You have a math problem</h3>
						<p>
							Henri's comes with a whole Math library of functions. So if you like to to experimental stuff with your Sass,
							Henri's is your go to!
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						<h3>You are using Foundation</h3>
						<p>
							Well, if you are using foundation for it's components and styling, please keep using it! It's great for that. If
							you are just using it for the grid, henri's can help you out too!
